\section{Problem 3}
\subsection{Question}
Let $f$ be a real-valued function of two variables $(x,y)$ that is defined on the square $Q = \left\{ (x,y) \mid 0 \leq x \leq 1, 0 \leq y \leq 1\right\}$ and is a measurable function of $x$ for each fixed value of $y$. For each $(x,y) \in Q$, suppose that the partial derivatives $\partial f / \partial y$ exist. Suppose that there is a function $g$ that is integrable over $[0,1]$ and such that
\[\left| \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} (x,y)\right| \leq g(x), \quad \forall(x,y) \in Q.\]
Prove that
\[\frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left[ \int_0^1 f(x,y) dx \right] = \int_0^1 \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} (x,y) dx, \]
for all $y \in [0,1]$.
\subsection{Answer}
\begin{proof}
Define the derivative at a point as the limit of a sequence of derivatives
\[\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} (x,y) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\partial f}{ \partial y} (x, y- 2^{-n}) \]
this sequence is dominated by $g$. We may therefore conclude by the dominated convergence theorem that 
\[\frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left[ \int_0^1 f(x,y) dx \right] = \int_0^1 \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} (x,y) dx, \]
as desired.
\end{proof}
